# Iptv

Usage
1. Open `playlist.m3u` with a compatible player (VLC, mpv, Kodi, etc.)
2. Or use the raw file URL once pushed: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechnologySR/M3U_Playlist/refs/heads/main/README.md

Notes
- Minimal normalization: moved the existing playlist content into `playlist.m3u` and removed the top-level repo title.
- I did not add a license (per your request).
- Some streams may be geo-blocked or offline. If you want, I can run a validation step to check which URLs return a 200/OK.
